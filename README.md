# kendallnakai.github.io

This is my simple, static, personal website. (For now) it will be completely 
HTML and CSS. 

GitHub is where I am editing and hosting my personal website! I started out a few 
years ago using Weebly then switched to Wix website generators. I recently 
decided that it was time to go on my own, creative limb and develop a personal 
website. It is inspired by some simple website templates but for the most part
this website remains simple yet personalized with my own touches.
