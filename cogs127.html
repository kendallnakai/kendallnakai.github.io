    <h1> Yelp Polls </h1>
    <h3> Application Feature Extension Project </h3>
    <h3> UC San Diego (COGS 127 - Data-Driven UX/Product Design) </h3>

    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p>
    I worked alongside a team of three in the course, Design Human-Data Interactions
    to research, design, and extend a feature to the popular mobile application,
    Yelp. Since high school, I have wished features of Yelp were more engaging but
    never knew that I could begin to work to do something different for it. With
    the help fo this class, I was able to make a project I did not even know I
    wanted to do a reality.
    </p>
    <p>
    Because I was so engaged, I was able to contribute a lot to aspects of the
    project I wanted to learn from like creating the background of users, the
    reason for implemnting a Yelp extension, and the way the team researched the
    user to determine what Yelp extension would be most helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
    Following that, I had a lot of fun learning how to create user flows and try
    to imagine being the one using it for the first time. I also mapped out 20
    different sketches of possibilities of different aspects of the application.
    </p>
    <p>
    I turned these sketches on the screen to one of the user flows of real
    "clickable" papers. It was interesting to see user's contacts with the paper
    "screens." I articulated the user testing point-of-view and from that analysis
    decided what the next steps of design were.
    </p>
    <p>
    Moving into high fidelity prototyping, I created alternative screens than my
    team's to give two points of view as well as different identites and features
    a single screen could hold. It was interesting to compare the possibilities of
    the same idea with a different design.
    </p>
    <p>
    I then tested the screens on two users and polished them to not only fit
    the standard iPhone X format but also was able to make use of the user feedback
    to clear up any misconceptions or confusion the previous screens had caused.
    </p>

    <h2> Research Goals </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Determine what percent and frequency of participants used Yelp</li>
      <li>Discover demographics of these users</li>
      <li>Find out how and what these users utilized Yelp for</li>
      <li>Ask what features these users would be interested in being implemented</li>
    </ol>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2> Research Methods </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Survey</li>
      <p> Insert picture of survey </p>
      <p>Our team sent out a online Google Form survey and received responses
        from 150+ people. The purpose of the survey was to allow a large set
        people to share their personal Yelp experiences.</p>
      <p> We sent out a survey through Facebook Messenger, Facebook Student and
        San Diego Food Groups, in-class links, and via word-of-mouth. We targeted
        people that use social media groups because they would be most inclined
        to meet up via an app. We received 150+ responses. </p>

      <li>Interviews</li>
      <p> Insert picture of interview participants </p>
      <p> Our team conducted 9 one-on-one interviews with survey participants
          who were willing to provide us with more insight into their experiences.
          We wanted to dive deeper into the how these users interacted with the
          Yelp app and the strengths and shortcomings of the app in its current
          state.</p>
      <p> At the end of the survey, we asked if participants would like to share
         their experiences in an interview. From the 150+ survey respondents, we
         conducted 9 interviews. </p>

      <li>Direct observations</li>
      <p> Insert videos of the the observations </p>
      <p>Our team directly observed 6 students while they addressed housing-related
         issues. We sat as silent observers as these students confronted and
         discussed housing-related issues with their housemates. This gave us an
         opportunity to see where students were and were not successful in
         addressing issues. After directly observing these 6 students, we
         followed up with them afterwards to ask them more questions about their
         interaction. </p>
      <p> During the interviews, we asked if participants would be willing to
         screen share how they select places to eat on Yelp and share them as well
         as their thoughts on the current state of Yelp. </p>
      <p> The participants of this research were relevant to get an idea of who
         uses the app and what feature they’d like from our ideas to know which
         would be meaningful if implemented. </p>
    </ul>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2> Research Findings </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Users have trouble selecting a storefront in a timely manner</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Searches can generate over 200+ results</li>
          <li> Takes time to review the options</li>
          <li> Can cause frustration and confusion when attempting to coordinate plans</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Inconsistent method for sharing Yelp results with others</li>
        <ul>
          <li> Most users do not utilize the sharing tool that Yelp provides </li>
          <li> Prefer sending screenshots or face-to-face discussion</li>
          <li> No “go-to” method for sharing locations</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p> Insert the poll results picture of "How do you share places you see on Yelp to make plans"</p>

    <h2> Problem statement </h2>
    <p> Friends need a reliable, consistent way to coordinate restaurant choices
         and availability in order to efficiently meet up and share a meal
          together.</p>

    <h2> User Personas </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Tim is a project manager at a tech company. He has been extremely
        overwhelmed with work lately that he feels like he doesn’t have time to
        catch up with his friends through dinner. Finding a restaurant and
        coordinating with multiple people takes too long and often takes the fun
        out of wanting to catch up with friends. </li>
      <li> Jared just moved to a new city for his first year of college and is
        having trouble coordinating plans with all the new people he has met.
        He would like a trusted resource to assist in finding and deciding upon
        new places to visit in this new city to ensure that he and his friends
        have a great time. </li>
      <li>Vivian is an avid foodie. She loves using Yelp to find new, delicious
        restaurants to eat at and share that passion with friends. However, she
        has noticed that there isn’t a reliable way to share a restaurant with
        friends and coordinate with them besides messaging back and forth with
        different friends. She wants to be able to coordinate with friends easily
        after finding a place to eat at.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Breakdown: Each of the individuals above live very different lives,
      but face the same problem when it comes down to making plans with friends:
       there is not an efficient and consistent solution for sharing and agreeing
        upon a storefront between multiple people. With no consistency, this
        process can eat up valuable time and may cause users, like Tim, to shy
         away from making plans with friends or family.</p>

     <h2> Competitive Audit </h2>
     <p> Insert chart </p>
     <ul>
       <li>Foursquare has a focus on quick searches to find different categories of storefronts with an easy-to-use search tool. The search engine and layout of the results is quite similar to the search tool and list layout of Yelp. However, Foursquare does not have many features that extend further into instant messaging platforms for seamless communication between contacts. Overall, this app focuses on the search tool to discover storefronts, and does not get involved with the communication to coordinate plans with others.</li>
       <li>Zagat has a focus on highly rated restaurants based upon ratings provided from customer surveys. With this rating system, only restaurants with higher scores are featured with the zagat search tool. This decreases the number of storefronts that the user has to navigate through, which can potentially increase the time spent on selecting a restaurant. What makes Zagat unique is it’s guides and articles for the location the user is searching in. This provides well-written information that the user can reference. </li>
       <li>Postmates specializes in providing food delivery. However, the search feature and restaurant info can be helpful for a user when deciding on a place to eat. For easy communication between user and delivery person, Postmates has an integration with the user’s phone number for texting and calls. This feature is very helpful for relaying important information and ensure that the delivery is a success. Since Postmates focuses on delivery, the app does not have features for making reservations or sharing storefronts with others.</li>
       <li>Grubhub is mainly used for food delivery and takeout. The app has features for delivery or takeout from restaurants near the user’s location using a search engine. Once again, the search feature is similar to Yelp’s search feature, but Yelp does not have the option to order food in-app without directly contacting the storefront. In addition, Grubhub does not have social features to share or make reservations as the main focus is on delivery and takeout. </li>
       <li>OpenTable is designed for placing reservations at restaurants quickly and easily online. It’s search tool is meant for finding a restaurant to make a reservation, as time, date, and number of people in the party is required to trigger the search. This application is even integrated in Yelp for placing a reservation. Yelp currently, does not have it’s own reservation feature, and relies on the user to call the storefront directly, or use the OpenTable redirect option found in the Yelp app.  </li>
     </ul>

    <h2> UX Flows </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Flow 1</li>
      <p> Insert user flow picture</p>
      <p>The entry point for this UX flow is the storefront page that is chosen
         by the user already. This is because our goal here is to make it easier
         for the user to share a storefront that they want to send to friends.
         For this UX flow, users can easily share the storefront they found to
          group chats in Messenger and from there, they can make a reservation.
          After making the reservation, the whole group can see the date/time,
          and then they can choose to add that to their calendar or check the
          directions to the storefront. These functions help consolidate all the
           information needed into one area, and the user can easily access it
          on Messenger. </p>
      <li>Flow 2</li>
      <p> Insert user flow picture</p>
      <p>The entry point for this UX flow is opening the Yelp app. This is
        because our goal here is to start and finish within the Yelp app,
        and have all the group functions done in the app. For this UX flow,
        users can create a group and add people that they wish to eat together
        with. Then, they can find a restaurant and add it to a poll that the
         group can see. Friends can also do the same, and everyone can vote on
          different restaurant choices. When finished, the restaurant with the
           most votes is chosen, and everyone can see the result in the group. </p>
      </ul>

    <h2> User testing </h2>
    <p> Insert pictures for testing </p>
    <ul>
      <li> User 1
For prototype A, User 1 like that they could make a reservation in Messenger with a Yelp extension. They also like that all the information for the restaurant and reservation can be displayed on the chat in Messenger. One thing that was confusing for User 1 was that the UI for prototype A was based on iOS (iPhones), and they were not familiar with that, so some interactions were not intuitive.
For prototype B, User 1 like how easy it was to make a poll and vote on restaurants. They also thought that it was an efficient way in deciding with friends on where to eat without the hassle of sharing different restaurant links in a message. One thing that was confusing for User 1 was the button placements for the screen to vote and close the group poll. They didn’t know what to do after voting, whether they should press “Close Poll” or not.

User 1 preferred the UI of Prototype B as it was simpe to navigate, but like how for Prototype A you can use it for friends on Messenger.</li>
      <li> User 2
For prototype A, User 2 like that they could just look at restaurant information in the chat and that they could also make a reservation quite easily. One thing that they struggled with was where to click, especially for the shared Yelp restaurant message in Messenger chat. Some interaction didn’t seem intuitive, which caused user confusion on where to go next.
For prototype B, User 2 like how there was a function to make a group poll with friends you choose and that it was really easy to add a chosen restaurant to the poll. One thing they struggled with was with the “Close Poll” button. They didn’t know if they should press the button or it was going to be assumed that someone else would be closing the group poll.

User 2 preferred Prototype A because they are feel more comfortable already with messaging people are Messenger.</li>
      <li> User 3
For prototype A, User 3 also liked that there is an option to create a reservation in chat so that it makes plans more concrete with friends. They struggled with knowing where to click since different buttons had different styles (boxed vs. rounded), so it was confusing which buttons were interactive and which were just displayed as information.
For prototype B, User 3 liked that everyone in the group can add restaurants and vote on different restaurants. One thing that was confusing was the ownership the group poll. They didn’t know if they had ownership of the group poll so they didn’t know if they should be the one to close the poll.

User 3 preferred Prototype B since it had the function to vote on different restaraunts with friends and that it was easier to navigate around.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> User point of view </p>
    <p> Pros and Cons</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Overall</li>
      <li>+ Users were interested in aspects of both Flow #1 and Flow #2</li>
      <li>-  The functionality of these in-Yelp and in-Mesesenger features were not
 useful to non-Yelp users and the design was sometimes confusing to
 non-iPhone users</li>
      <li>Prototype + Flow A</li>
        <ul>
          <li>+ [Reservations + Design] Users enjoyed the easy reservation option and
     mused that the design was similar to Yelp and Messenger but remained
     equally sleek and simple</li>
          <li>-  [Sharing] Users were confused on whether the Yelp message cards when
    sharing a certain restaurant were clickable or simple, static messages and
    also weren’t quite sure how the sharing in the new iPhone OS worked</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Prototype + Flow B</li>
        <ul>
          <p>+ [Polls + Design] The UI overall was intuitive and polling with friends was
    useful. The user wished they had the polls function in the Flow #1 </p>
          <p>-  [Polls] Users were confused on whether every person in the group chat
    was required to vote before closing a poll and who could close the poll</p>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Based on this feedback, Group 1 interprets that we were able to successfully design and bridge the two most wanted features users were interested in from initial user research and overall make the user flow intuitive. The only caveat was minor design specifications and buttons being slightly unclear or requiring more user thinking about what they actually have to click next. </p>
      <p>For future design process, this means the group will overall stick with the Messenger and Yelp features implemented but edit buttons and use more arrows to make flows, where to click, and what is possible to be clicked more intuitive. 4</p>

    <h2> High-Fidelity Prototyping: Digital </h2>
    <p>Insert a picture of the flow</p>
    <p> Based on testing, it seems that users are interested in a mixed integration of polls, easy-to-access and sharing via the Messenger application, and simple restaurant reservations. </p>
    <p>Group 1 has decided to extend the easier to see Yelp sharing features to Messenger and actual functionality features to internal Yelp. </p>
    <p>1. Combine polls, reservations, and features with functionality (backend) to
     Yelp group chats that are either used solely in Yelp or extended from
     Messenger
     i.e. Groups can be made in Yelp but friends can link their Messenger
     friends into those groups to vote on ideas and later be reminded in
     Messenger about the plans made in Yelp). </p>
    <p>2. Add Yelp design features to Messenger so users can easily view
     a) Messages that are clickable Yelp cards (parallel to viewing Yelp app)
     b) Restaurant basic preview in-Messenger
     c) Reminders for plans made in Yelp app group chat</p>
     <p>3.  Correct confusing buttons and sending features by adding arrows on
      items that lead to a new screen and shadowed (grey) text on items that
      require typing</p>

    <h2> User Testing </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Terri L.
65 Years Old

Terri uses Yelp every once in awhile when looking for places to eat around her to meet up with fellow moms for lunch. Although she does not have a lot of experience using technology, she makes a good source for feedback because if interfaces are understandable for her, they are very intro user-friendly for most ages since she is not accostomed to using online applications often.

She was not very receptive to the Yelp messages feature since she did not want to complicate her technology usage by having more messaging platforms and also does not usually communicate in group messaging settings. While we could not remove the Yelp messaging feature, we did try to make it as similar to Apple iMessages in interface while keeping the Yelp aesthetic and limiting the additional sending features aside from text to three settings: adding a picture, poll, or place to eat.

Terri did like the polls feature because “choosing where to eat should be democratic” and also enjoys the idea of sending Yelp restaurant cards and clicking on them to see an overview since “not everyone has time to look for all the details” so we made sure to keep that feature intact. </li>
      <li>William T.
19 Years Old

William does not use Yelp but is comfortable with popular social media apps and often makes plans with friends to meet up to eat out. While he does not use Yelp, it is important to assess users understanding of an interface even without prior usage of the specific application. He had feedback directly regarding the comparison of the previous assignment alternates.
 See the side panel on the left.
He liked Alternate #1B better than #1A because it fit the overall Yelp look better than the other one. “I think the app should cater to the craft of the app over the look of the device.” We decided to compromise this and keep the familiarity of sending to group chats via a Apple iMessage start but use Yelp messages look to start brand new chats with friends.

William was more inclined to Alternate #2A than Alternate #2B because having the detail of polls all in one place “made sense.” We thought so too and since Yelp isn’t extremely minimalistic and “clean,” the functionality beat the form.



</li>
      <li>Quinten L.
21 Years Old

Quinten is a reliable source for feedback due to the fact that he is a consistent Yelp user when looking for new places to eat in his area. When shown the in-Yelp group poll, Quinten noted that a useful feature like this would possibly persuade him to use the Yelp messenger feature to commincate with friends (he had not used it before).

This remark, along with advice from others caused us to put more focus on building out the poll feature and design within the actual Yelp messenger screen. He also explained that it could get bothersome to continuously need to navigate from the poll screen to the messenger screen to keep others updated and make sure everyone within the group were on the same page.

We made sure to include pleny of tools and useful information for group messenger users to reference when viewing storefronts and options that other have suggested in messenger. This update will hopefully increase the efficiency of choosing a storefront with friends and limit the amount of navigation when voting and viewing restaurants with others.

    <h2> TA Feedback </h2>
    <p> After speaking with our TA, there were 2 main points that they emphasized needed a bit more improvement for our finalized high fidelity prototype. The first revolved around the design and overall usability of the Yelp messenger. Since this feature is a central component to our extended poll feature, the TA advised that we should think about putting more effort in redesigning this tool to make the poll as integrated and easy to use as possible within Yelp.

We took this feedback seriously and decided to add direct access to polls within the messenger and one-click basic storefront info so users do not need to navigate away from the messenger to search for important detail.

First of all, the Yelp messenger is quite bare and so these added features will hopefully pursuade users to utilize this in-app messenger.

Secondly, the TA informed us that our original popup message for confirming the end of a poll did not fit in with the Yelp UI. To remedy this we simply redesigned this to match the iPhone iOS 13 UI. Since our prototypes were designed for iPhone, this UI design of the popup will blend in nicely.

Keeping the TA’s advice in mind, we believe our updated prototype is more complete, efficient, and user-friendly than the previous prototype mock-up

    <h2>Final result</h2>
    <p>Picture of final flow</p>

    <h2> Reflection </h2>
    <p>I'm really proud of extending this Yelp messenger feature and improving
    the exsisting layout of it! This was my first project of its kind and I
    learned a lot from working alongside and being critiqued by designers. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Figma: I had never used Figma so learning how to mock ideas up on it,
      collaborate with others, and make components (very efficient) was useful.
      In the future, I hope to learn how to animate on Figma. </li>
      <li>UX Flows: I didn't even know where to start on UX Flows but it makes
        sense as it's how a user interacts step by step with special attention
        to what they could accidentally do if the flow or buttons aren't clear
        enough</li>
      <li> Research first! Because users the the base of products, of course
        research should be done for what <b>they want</b>. At first I wanted
        to simply go with an idea I had but learned designing for users and
        based on feedback is more effective.</li>    <h2> Reflection </h2>
